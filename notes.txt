2 methods i can currently think of / have found so far

either use subviewports and textures
or unproject the desired positions of the control nodes (e.g. the label) from 3d into 2d

idk which would be more performant

might wanna make the dialogue bubble texture expandable (like that tutorial did with the menu things): so that it expands to be whatever size needed by the label and infills itself whilst moving the borders outwards


might wanna remove leading and trailing whitespace in each line







need a global variable / ref to a timedirection enum or whatever etc

player dialogue options / forking

just make something as simple as poss for now; niceties (like adding variables to speech or executing dialogue-option dependent code) don't have to be done for a little while
